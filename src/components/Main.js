        <p> Of course my major interest is technology, because i'm a great believer on making money doing what you love the most. That's what i love the most so i am very grateful to also profit from it.
          I am also very passionate about Blockchain, WEB3 and investments in general. Other than the tech field i love wellness/fitness and nature.
